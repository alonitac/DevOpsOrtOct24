# Lambda Functions

## About serverless

Serverless architectures are a cloud computing paradigm that allows developers to build and deploy applications without the need to manage servers directly (PaaS).
In this model, the cloud provider takes care of server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance, enabling developers to focus solely on writing code and paying only for the actual resources consumed during execution. 

This approach offers reduced operational overhead, improved cost efficiency, and faster time-to-market for various types of applications and services.


## Face blurring using Lambda and Step Function State Machine

Tutorial source: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/blur-faces-in-videos-automatically-with-amazon-rekognition-video/

Face blurring is one of the best-known practices when anonymizing both images and videos.
We will implement an event-driven system for face blurring using composition of different Lambda functions and a state machine.

Here is the high level architecture:

![][aws_face-blur]

Let's get started.

**\* Deploy your resources in a region where [Amazon Rekognition is supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rekognition.html).**

### Create the Lambda Functions

#### Create the "face-detection" function

1. Open the [Functions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions) of the Lambda console\.
2. Choose **Create function**\.
3. Choose **Author from scratch**.
4. Create a `Python 3.9` runtime function from scratch.
5. Copy and deploy `face-blur-lambdas/face-detection/*.py` in the function source code page. Using the console code editor to create new python files as needed.
6. The IAM role of this function should have the following permissions: `AmazonS3FullAccess`, `AmazonRekognitionFullAccess` and `AWSStepFunctionsFullAccess`. It's recommended to use the same IAM role for all functions!
7. Configure a trigger for an **All object create** events for a given S3 bucket on objects with `.mp4` suffix (create a bucket and enable event notification if needed).


#### Create the "check-rekognition-job-status" function

1. Create a `Python 3.9` runtime function from scratch. Choose the same IAM role as the above function.
2. Copy and deploy `face-blur-lambdas/check-rekognition-job-status/lambda_function.py` as the function source code.

#### Create the "get-rekognized-faces" function

1. Create a `Python 3.9` runtime function from scratch. Choose the same IAM role as the above function.
2. Copy and deploy `face-blur-lambdas/get-rekognized-faces/lambda_function.py` as the function source code.

#### Create the "blur-faces" function

1. Create a **Container image** Lambda function based on the Docker image built from `face-blur-lambdas/blur-faces/Dockerfile`. Use an existing Docker image, or create a **private** ECR and build the image by:

    2. Open the Amazon ECR console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ecr/repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).
    3. In the navigation pane, choose **Repositories**\.
    4. On the **Repositories** page, choose **Create repository**\.
    5. For **Repository name**, enter a unique name for your repository\.
    6. Choose **Create repository**\.
    7. Select the repository that you created and choose **View push commands** to view the steps to build and push an image to your new repository\.

2. In your lambda page, choose **Configuration**, then choose **Environment variables**, add the following env var to this function:
   `OUTPUT_BUCKET=<bucket-name>` where `<bucket-name>` is another bucket to which the processes videos will be uploaded (create one if needed).
3. This function is CPU and RAM intensive since it processes the video frame-by-frame. Make sure this it has enough time and space to finish (in the **General Configuration** tab, increase the timeout to 5 minutes and the memory to 2048MB).


### Create Step Function state machine

1. Open the [Step Functions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/stepfunctions) of the Lambda console\.
2. Choose **Create state machine**.
3. In the **Choose a templat**e dialog box, select **Blank**.
4. In the Workflow Studio, click the **code** button.
3. Edit the JSON in the definition pane as follows:
    1. Copy and paste `face-blur-lambdas/state_machine.json`
    2. Change `<check-rekognition-job-status ARN>`, `<get-rekognized-faces ARN>` and `<blur-faces ARN>` according to the corresponding Lambda functions ARN.
4. Click **Create**.
6. It's recommended to enable **all logging** (can be done after the function is created).
8. Add the following env var to the **face-detection** function (the first function you've created):
   `STATE_MACHINE_ARN=<state-machine-ARN>`

### Test the system

1. Upload a sample short mp4 video to the "input" S3 bucket (you can download [this](../face-blur-lambdas/sample-video.mp4) video).
2. Observe the Lambda invocation, as well as the state machine execution flow.
3. Download the processes video from in "output" S3 bucket and watch the results.
